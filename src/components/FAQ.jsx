      id: 'item-4',
      question: "Can I cancel anytime?",

    },
    {
      id: 'item-7',
      question: "What happens if equipment breaks?",
      answer: "We inspect your equipment during every visit. If we spot an issue, we'll notify you immediately with repair options and fair pricing. We can handle most repairs in-house.",
    },
    {
      id: 'item-8',
      question: "How do I get started?",
