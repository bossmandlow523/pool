5. Visual Branding & Tone Analysis

Color Palette & Style: Strong use of aquatic blues and turquoise combined with white. Promotional graphics use gradients of blue with white text and icons, evoking clean, fresh water. The profile and cover photos feature crystal‑clear pools, which reinforces the theme of sparkling cleanliness.

Imagery & Photography: Real photographs of pools being cleaned and equipment in use. Images include workers skimming or brushing pools and close‑ups of pool surfaces. Promotional graphics include before‑and‑after images (“green to clean”) and icons depicting pool maintenance tasks.

Tone of Voice: Friendly, informal and community‑oriented. The intro emphasises being a “small local family‑owned pool company looking to serve our community”
facebook.com
 and uses exclamation points. Promotional copy invites customers to call for free estimates and highlights affordable packages. Comments from followers are casual and supportive.

Overall Aesthetic: The branding combines real‑life photos with professionally designed graphics. The graphics use modern sans‑serif fonts mixed with occasional script lettering (for the business name) against aqua backgrounds. The aesthetic conveys a balance of professionalism (through clean design and organized lists of services) and personal touch (through photos of the owner/worker in action). The emphasis on blue water, clear pools and “green to clean” transformations makes it clear the business specialises in restoring and maintaining pools.
